# The Liberty Project

## AVAA for SEO
(`Adaptive Virtual Application Architecture` for Search Engine Optimization)

### The Framework Architecture

Originally created to support the necessary architecture for the ColdFusion SEO research projects, Liberty has evolved into a complete and robust application framework capable of supporting almost any application need. Liberty is an object-oriented MVC (model view controller) type of application framework with many advanced proprietary features. Liberty uses a concept of virtual URIs that can be driven from almost any form of data and/or business logic to facilitate adaptation. Furthermore, Liberty is built upon the concepts of OOP (object-oriented programming) and is extremely extensible and scalable.

Liberty in its present form is a ColdFusion Java/J2EE based application framework capable of operating within any J2EE environment as well as full-tier integration with Microsoft .NET services. Liberty has been developed with ultimate performance as a priority and must maintain performance to support such SEO engines as City-Centers and City-Destinations (among others). Liberty has many cutting-edge features built-in, including on-the-fly compression support and a flexible intelligent caching model. Overall, Liberty is a cutting-edge high-performance highly extensible application framework capable of supporting from tiny to huge web application developments, including the ability to serve mobile devices. Presently, Liberty is capable of uniquely identifying more than 297 mobile devices, which can drive specific display and functionality for each given device. This feature can be leveraged for a wide variety of uses, including direct marketing towards the targeted device type itself (e.g., iPhone apps for iPhones, Android apps for Androids, or other such applications and services).

### As a Web Application/eCommerce Platform

Because of its performance and flexibility, Liberty makes for an incredibly robust platform on which to develop most any typical web applications and eCommerce systems. With the Adaptive Virtual Application Architecture that Liberty provides, applications become second to none in their ability to enhance search engine optimization. Liberty provides mechanisms to maintain the highest level of pertinent textual context for every request. Additionally, Liberty has the ability to adapt with context through time and driven by any feasible mechanism one can derive through data, environment, and business logic. These features enable a site built on Liberty to generate the greatest URI to Content link strength possible, adapt that relationship over time and/or business logic, and ensure the greatest contextual indexing by search engines. Additionally, Liberty allows for mechanisms not available in traditional application architectures that can create the greatest contextual link density possible. Simply put, Liberty is magic for SEO.

### As a Support Engine Application

An example of an adaptive SEO support engine, City-Centers was a non-traditional city directory utilizing the United States cities to achieve search engine dominance. City-Centers was an advertising platform similar to YellowPages, Dex, SuperPages, and other similar city directories online today. However, these traditional directories group their advertisers' businesses together, placing advertising competitors side-by-side. This results in good search engine ranking for the directory but not so good ranking for the advertisers themselves. While advertisers may achieve favorable ranking within the directories themselves, they typically achieve poor results within the common search engines such as Google, Bing, Yahoo, and others.

City-Centers, as an advertiser directory, is unique. Although City-Centers was an advertising platform similar to many traditional directories, it was the only web promotional city directory online at the time. City-Centers offered the advertiser the option to link-back to the directory and elements within. This is a key element that indicates to the search engines that the City-Centers directory is not link spamming to the advertiser's site. City-Centers also shows search engines a growing number of links pointing to our clients' websites, indicating to the search engines that the link density and popularity are growing. These growing numbers of links make the search engines sustain our clients' search rankings at a very high indexing weight (e.g., top rankings).

The City-Centers system was one of a kind. While many companies have tried to copy the system, none have succeeded. For several years we have been developing and polishing the fundamental concepts that made the City-Centers system work. The invention of the Liberty Project has been instrumental in finalizing the mechanics to make all of this possible. With this, we are now ready to finalize and polish out the finished product of the Liberty Project and utilize this product to develop the first-ever International City Directory and take our system global. With this, we will have several levels of advertisement available:
- **City Ads**: Advertisement within city/town/county localized regions.
- **State Ads**: Advertisement within every city specific to state/province regions.
- **National Ads**: Advertisement within every city within a given country or at the state directory pages only.
- **Portal Ads**: Advertisers can purchase a portal (this is a full page advertisement space) within their local city region, within all cities in their state/province, or nationally in every city within their country. They can place their portal in only countries they operate within or internationally, placing a page in every city in the world.

### Web Application and Support Engines Working Together

This is where the power of Liberty really shines. There are many features built into Liberty that allow SEO support engines (such as the City-Centers project) and client sites to work together, exchanging information and creating the ultimate SEO environment. The SEO support engines have the ability to process site-maps, RSS feeds, and in-page meta-data from the client site to formulate the most optimum in-context linkage back to the client site. Additionally, keywords and key-phrases can be configured within the SEO support engines (subscription revenue opportunity) that can further link keywords and key-phrases from within the content context within the SEO support engine itself. Additionally, these targeted keywords and key-phrases can be linked back for reciprocal linking. This creates an unprecedented level of index density and relevance that is not possible on a single site alone. Additionally, configurations can be created to strengthen localized targeted results that are not possible within single site configurations.

## Next Steps

- Code review and top-down testing of Liberty for final release.
- Market and release licensing and services for other Liberty products.
- Further develop the experimental RSS feed processing system currently in testing with Liberty.
- Further develop this technology for other market areas.
